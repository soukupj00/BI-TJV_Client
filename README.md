# Client application for my semestral work in BI-TJV

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

This is a web application, that, sort of, simulates, how a basic server and web page might look for a small gym business.

Web allows users to add: addresses, fitness centers and staff. User can edit and delete each entity.

Implemented is also assigning staff to fitness centers, provided by special api request.

This was mainly done for learning purposes, this is not a representation of `real` website.

While working on this client I learned quite a few things about React and css styling. It was quite enjoyable to learn React and css...definitely when it worked, a bit less when it did not.
